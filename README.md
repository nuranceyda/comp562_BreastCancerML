# Classifying breast tumors using machine learning methods
##Brief
In this project, we employ various machine learning algorithms to determine the best model for classifying malignant versus benign breast tumors based on cell-nucleus measurements. 
##Course Component
This project was created in association with COMP 562: Intro to Machine Learning course taught by Professor Jorge Silva at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
